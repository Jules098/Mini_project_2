# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
#### Gather and create a database of Points Of Interest (POI) in my neighbourhood. 
#### Include bars, restaurants, and other places of interest (parks, tourist locals, neighbourhood sights).
#### Compare and contrast the quality of the API coverage of the area.

## Process
## Step 1: 
### Pull Foursquare API data for my neighbourhood.
### Organize, analyze and store Foursquare API data.
## Step 2:
### Pull Yelp API data for my neighbourhood.
### Organize, analyze and store Yelp API data.
## Step 3: 
### Create SQL database schema.
## Step 4:
### Organize, analyze and store API data into SQL database schema.
## Step 5:
### Evaluate and assess data coverage from both APIs.


## Results
The Foursquare API pulled in more unique values for Museums, theaters, pool halls and parks. Yelp's API was able to pull in more unique values for bars, bakeries, and cafes.  Foursquare's API values had more accurate review data as a result of their 10 star reviews, rather than 5 used by Yelp. 

Overall I would say the Yelp API had better quality and quantity of data when it came to the dining and drinking info.  Foursquare's API was easier to gather data from because of it's fields query function, and it had more data in the Arts and Entertainment, and Outdoors and Landmarks categories.

## Challenges 
Getting used to the yelp API probably took me longer than it should have.  Once I did however it felt like smooth sailing.  I would say the biggest challenge has been the end process of taking all the data I have accumulated and turning it into something.

## Future Goals
With more time I would like to gather different dimensions from the API calls and dig deeper into richer data categories.  Fleshing out a deeper picture with more data could lead to questions and ideas I haven't even yet thought of.
